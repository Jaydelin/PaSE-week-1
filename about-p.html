                Our hotel has several swimming pools of various sizes.

The main swimming pool has a size of about 385 sqm (27.5 x 14.5 m). There is also a slightly smaller swimming pool with two water slides and a separate children's pool next to it (5.0 x 5.5 m and 0.30 cm deep). The children's pool has a sun protection.
Above-mentioned swimming pools are open from 7:00 to 19:00. Outside these times, swimming is not permitted for safety reasons.
Changes in opening times - for example, due to weather conditions - are reserved and subject to the decision of hotel management.
Please understand that for special events that take place on some evenings around the swimming pools, this area must be cleared for the preparations from approximately 17:00.
